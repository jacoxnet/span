# Span

This console C++ program calculates the minimum spannning tree for a weighted, undirected graph
using Prim's algorithm.

Prepared for Coursera's C++ Programming for C Programmers, Part A.

## Files
- *driver.cpp* Main loop. Allows user to specify whether to load the specific course graph (data.txt), calculate a random graph, or use a graph from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-using-priority_queue-stl/ 
- *matrix.cpp* Implements class for weighted undirected graph. Includes functionality to generate graphs (including randomly), and perform the Prim algorithm.
- *matrix.h* Header file for class
- *data.txt* Test data from the course to use for graph.
